      Get ready for an incredible evening of dancing, learning, and connection
      on October 11th!

      We’re thrilled to welcome you to a full day of salsa fun, kicking off at
      3pm with "Salsa Next Level" — a special workshop led by the dynamic duo
      Nicolai and Andreas. Whether you're looking to polish your fundamentals or
      challenge yourself with something new, this 2-hour session (3–5pm) is the
      perfect way to take your dancing up a notch.

      After the workshop, we’ll break for dinner from 5–7pm. You’re warmly
      invited to join us for a shared meal — a great chance to connect, relax,
      and fuel up before the party. Or if you prefer, feel free to make your own
      dinner plans and rejoin us after.


      At 7:30pm, we open the doors to our evening social, with dancing
      continuing all the way through to 1am. At 8pm, Nicolai will be back with a
      class to kick off the social in style, followed by a vibrant mix of salsa
      from our DJs. Then, from 9pm onwards, we’ll switch gears into pure SBK
      (Salsa, Bachata, Kizomba) — giving you the perfect opportunity to enjoy a
      wider variety of rhythms and connect with even more dancers on the floor.


      Whether you're here for the lessons, the party, or the community, we can’t
      wait to see you there!
